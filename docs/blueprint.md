## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark forest green (#3A5F0B) to convey sophistication and a sense of growth. This deep tone is versatile and professional.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated green (#F0FAF0). This near-white backdrop enhances readability and focuses attention on the portfolio content.
- Accent color: Muted olive (#808000). This analogous hue offers subtle contrast, suitable for highlights or interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a clean, modern, neutral aesthetic suitable for both headings and body text.
- Timeline-based layout to guide users through the portfolio in a chronological and visually engaging way.
- Subtle animations like fading in/out of images on scroll, and smooth transitions for modal windows.
- Minimal, outline-style icons for categories and filters.
